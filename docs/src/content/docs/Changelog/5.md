## Circuit

This week, I rebuilt my circuit with generous assistance. I removed Programmable Air in favor of using the air pump components directly.

I started by transferring the circuit to a larger breadboard, since it now has 4 sections with 5 attachments (USB power, power supply, 2 air pumps, air valve):

1. Arduino 33 Nano IoT, hooked up to USB power
2. Air valve: solenoid screwed into a screw terminal on the billboard, with a diode to TIP102
3. [Sparkfun motor driver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14451) with capacitors, connected to Arduino and the 2 air pumps
4. Power input: 9V power supply hooked up to a L7805 voltage regulator and heat sink

The motor architecture is more complicated than I expected, but every component serves a clear purpose. Each air pump can only go one direction, and since I want to both blow and suck in this project (as the air quality worsens then improves), I need two pumps. The motor driver lets me programmatically turn each one on successively. The two pumps are connected by silicone tubing, and the solenoid air valve switches which oneâ€™s airflow is output to the pillow.

Electrically, the project runs at a total of ~12V, split into two circuits. The Arduino pulls its 3.3V over USB. Separately, a 9V variable power supply powers the 5V air valve plus the 4.5V air pump (only one at a time). The voltage regulator that regulates the power input generates a ton of heat even at 9V, so a heat sink improves safety. (Without a heatsink, any nearby cables produce a noticeable scent from the heat radiating off the voltage regulator.)

I soldered my own motor driver to header pins, which was the first time I soldered header pins. Unfortunately, even after successfully checking continuity with a multimeter, the component failed. I also soldered the two leads on each of the two air pumps, but the first time I put them in my backpack, 3/4 cable connections snapped. That was my first time desoldering, which took at least an hour longer than I expected, but with some help from the shop staff, I removed the old cable ends and solder and soldered fresh cables, this time with heat shrink on all the connections, and verified the electrical connections again.

- [x] Resolder solidcore wires onto motors
- [ ] Lay flat the wires
- [ ] Try analogWrite 0-255 to PWM pins to get slower speed
- [x] Reintegrate Arduino IO

## Arduino

I started over on the Arduino software without Programmable-Air in the mix. I set up the motor driver pins, plus the air valve, as digital ouputs of the Arduino, and made a test program that would turn on the first motor for two seconds then the second pump for four seconds to validate everything was working.

```cpp
const int motor1Pin = 4;    // Motor driver 1 leg 1 (pin 4, AO1)
const int motor2Pin = 5;    // Motor driver 1 leg 2 (pin 5, AO2)
const int motor3Pin = 7;    // Motor driver 2 leg 1 (pin 7, BO1)
const int motor4Pin = 8;    // Motor driver 2 leg 2 (pin 8, BO2)
const int valvePin = 12;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  pinMode(motor1Pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor2Pin, OUTPUT);

  pinMode(motor4Pin, OUTPUT);

  pinMode(pwm2Pin,   OUTPUT);

  pinMode(valvePin,  OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {

  digitalWrite(valvePin, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motor1Pin, LOW);

Next, I re-integrated Adafruit IO to conttrol the stages over Wi-Fi:
