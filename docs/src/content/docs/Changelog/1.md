This week, I learned to cut a sheet of mylar and use a heat press to create inflatable pouches. I wanted to try the simplest possible version of inflating a material then putting a circuit inside it.

(What is mylar? [Two kinds of plastic invented by DuPont.](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/what-is-mylar-made-of-zx_IAEXPQku8CWI1PyrB9A))

My own mylar sheet I made into a brain-shaped pouch, with a big hole in the end for inflating with my mouth, or the blood pressure pump.

For the circuit, I've just got a button that lights up an LED when you press it:

Of course, the mylar is fairly opaque, so it wouldn’t actually be a good fit for putting lights inside, and buttons inside an inflatable project don’t make sense. In a dark room, though, the light is spread a little by the mylar, and using an array of LEDs would help.
