**What is your piece communicating?**

**Who are you communicating to/with? (Yourself, someone in particular, a group of people, an animal, the computer, etc.)**

I don’t have a specific audience in mind for this piece. Anyone who puts it on above a certain age level and with sufficient English proficiency can engage with it. This story is not well-known.

**How does your piece communicate? What tools (gesture, color, text, audio, LEDs, movement, etc.) are you using to communicate your message?**

The piece communites visually, through the interactive slides, plus through touch, with the pillow inflating.

**What is the desired reaction you are aiming for with this piece?**

I’m aiming for intrigue, and engagement—people who never would have expected to care about air quality become engaged with the project and start thinking about the topic.

**How did what you aimed to communicate change over the process?**

At the beginning, I was focused on the London story, but through playtesting, many participants haven’t been to London and the story didn’t resonate as much. I added connections to New York City, such as through congestion pricing, to make the story more local.

**Discuss what your piece communicates to the outside world other than your target audience. Try to step outside yourself for this exercise.**

The piece is subdued, funky, and looks slightly medical from the outside—many people compared the physical design to a blood pressure cuff, plus it has silicone tubing entering it.

**If you saw someone wearing your piece, what would you think? What draws your eye first?**

1. What are they seeing in VR? (the eternal question for VR installations)
2. What’s around their neck? Is it moving?

**What senses does your piece activate in those around you? (Sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch)**

There’s noise from the motors, though it was far less audible in the show environment. It’s primarily the visual.

**How might you utilize an additional sensory modality to improve how your piece communicates?**

I would love to have added sound: ships coming up the Thames, factory noise, traffic & chaos in the smog, but I didn’t have the time to source the sounds & consider the equipment. (The Meta Quest’s speakers don’t isolate people well in a crowded environment.) Having headphones on would have better isolated viewers into this world, and the sounds could place them in time.
