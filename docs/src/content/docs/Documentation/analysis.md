**Communication:**

- What is your piece communicating?

  - Who are you communicating to/with? (Yourself, someone in particular, a group of people, an animal, the computer, etc.)

  - How does your piece communicate?

    - What tools (gesture, color, text, audio, LEDs, movement, ect.) are you using to communicate your message?

  - What is the desired reaction you are aiming for with this piece?

    - How did what you aimed to communicate change over the process?

- Discuss what your piece communicates to the outside world other than your target audience. Try to step outside yourself for this exercise.

  - If you saw someone wearing your piece, what would you think? What draws your eye first?

- What senses does your piece activate in those around you? (Sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch)

  - How might you utilize an additional sensory modality to improve how your piece communicates?
