**London Smog** is a story about the history of air quality in London.
It has two parts: a website experience, ideally in VR, and a wearable pillow that inflates around your neck to simulate the air quality throughout the story in a physical way.

Presented at the [2024 ITP Winter Show](https://itp.nyu.edu/shows/winter2024/) in Downtown Brooklyn.
